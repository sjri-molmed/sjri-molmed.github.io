# NRPred - A tool for predicting predominant nuclear receptors in breast cancer

[WebLink](here)

This innovative predictive tool is designed to estimate the probabilities of proportions for key nuclear receptorsâ€”Estrogen Receptor (ER), Progesterone Receptor (PR), Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR), and Androgen Receptor (AR) in breast cancer samples. Leveraging insights from 24 critical regulatory genes modulated by these nuclear receptors, the tool employs advanced computational algorithms to deliver precise receptor profiling.

By analyzing gene expression patterns, the tool helps researchers and clinicians:
- Identify the receptor landscape in breast cancer samples.
- Understand the regulatory dynamics influencing tumor behavior.
- Support personalized treatment planning by predicting receptor-specific responses.
- This tool is a valuable resource for oncology research and clinical diagnostics, enabling better-informed therapeutic strategies in the management of breast cancer.
